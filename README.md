# OSWE-Course
Some scripts for OSWE course


#### AWAE-update Hosts File
During the course there are some machines that should be spawned. The IP address might change and the hostname cannot be resolved.
To make life easier this script will ask you to enter the third octet of the IP address. This is known if you have started a machine.
After running the script as `sudo` it will update the `/etc/hosts` file. A backup is created first.

As always before you run any script, check the code before you execute it!
